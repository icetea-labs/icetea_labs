    "intro": "Hashed and Icetea Labs, as strategic partners, will co-build a self-sustainable, interoperable, open metaverse and GameFi ecosystem in the long run.",
    "content": [
      "Since the latter half of 2021, GameFi and metaverse have driven the crypto market; henceforth, a dozen of crypto games have launched per month and led to a wider selection of games that users can choose from. But as one delves deeper into this space, crypto games are actually facing hardships in implementing a sustainable in-game economy. Simultaneously, even emerging metaverses are extant only on trailers, casting doubt on the wide discrepancy between vision and reality. The market is starting to see faltering games with a short-term focus and an unsustainable in-game economy.",
      "Sharing a common vision and understanding of the potentials for and challenges to the future of GameFi and metaverse, Hashed and Icetea Labs shook hands to form a strategic partnership without termination dates.",
      "To be specific, the two strategic partners will explore the details to cooperate closely in an on-hands manner in GameFi and metaverse with regard to R&D and financing, ranging from infrastructure layers, platforms, and services, to interoperable flagship products, supporting the full lifecycle of games and metaverses (i.e. tokenomics design, launch plan, marketing, and etc.).",
      "The strategic collaboration is expected to fuel the overall growth of the gaming and metaverse industry, especially in the Asia Pacific.",
      "Jun Park, Investment Associate at Hashed focusing on crypto investments through the eyes of gaming: “In reality, the number of crypto games that are officially launched with meaningful daily active users is low. I have noticed faltering projects which were not able to converge their vision and reality at the end of the day. From 2022 along with Icetea Labs, I hope to see and will actively search for genuine GameFi projects with the following, non-exhaustive traits: 1) fair game mechanics; 2) play-to-earn through time-based efforts; 3) circular economy with low treasury intervention; 4) gaming fundamentals being fun at its core.”",
      "Edward Hong, Head of Growth at Hashed: “SEA (Southeast Asia) is the region with the fastest-growing adoption of blockchain games and GameFi. It is mesmerizing that blockchain games like Axie Infinity are now entirely transforming the economic patterns of people living in the region. Through this partnership, Hashed will work closely with Icetea Labs in the region to actively discover founders and support them to create a new value.”",
      "Thi Truong, founder of Icetea Labs: \"Blockchain gaming and metaverse industry suffer if companies just want to take away from it rather than contributing. There are many missing pieces and supporting systems that need to be built seriously and with a long-term vision in mind. In 2022 and the years to come, Icetea Labs devotes itself to research and experiments of sustainable economic models, designing cross-game and cross-metaverse mechanisms, building workforce and inhabitants for metaverses, and collaborating on infrastructure effort. We are very happy to work together with Hashed, one of the most visionary leaders in crypto space, on this journey.\"",
      "Hashed is an early-stage venture firm focused on blockchain protocols. Led by serial entrepreneurs and engineers, Hashed focuses on expediting global blockchain adoption through strategic investments and community building. Based in South Korea, San Francisco, Singapore and Bangalore, Hashed has cultivated industry-defining web3 founders around the globe by accelerating protocols such as Terra Money, Axie Infinity, Klaytn, Link, and The Sandbox. Hashed additionally operates metaverse studio UNOPND and Korean cryptocurrency custodian KODA.",

Operating two of the best performing launchpads, GameFi.org and Red Kite, Icetea Labs has advised, strategically invested, and launched many high profile games and metaverses such as Bloktopia, Sidus, Solice, etc. Icetea Labs also owns Mirai game studio, and is working closely with several industry-leading partners on critical gaming and metaverse initiatives."

    "intro": "The market is far beyond the gaming or blockchain communities, which can get easily onboarded from regular platforms like smartphones or laptops. Thus, a new metaverse utilizing the cutting edge technology of blockchain and giving the users an immersive experience within virtual reality (VR) is what makes Solice becomes one of the hottest projects recently.",
    "content": [
      "\bWhat is Solice?\b Solice is a VR Metaverse built on the Solana blockchain which is the fastest blockchain by far and is one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in the crypto world. Many platforms are supported in the Solice metaverse, removing the barrier of disparate hardware, software, and operating systems. This allows users to invite more friends and family, increasing the user base's exponential growth potential.",
      "The Solice metaverse is built to provide people as much freedom as possible, much like in real life. By using the Solice native token, users can participate in democratic governance. The governance mechanism will be based on a liquid democracy and real-world inspiration rules and done via a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).",
      "\bHighlights About Solice\b Solice, created by a core team of senior software engineers and creative designers, with assistance from VR gaming experts and crypto/DeFi veterans, promises to be the most immersive and engaging virtual world in the blockchain world.",
      "One of the most exciting aspects of Solice is the limitless possibilities in its open 3D world: a Metaverse VR where users can play, build, own, exchange, and monetize their virtual experiences in an immersive way on the Solana blockchain.",
      "What makes Solice different from current metaverse projects is the ability to improve the user experience, connecting them through VR and cross-platform technology. Currently, most metaverse projects are only on a single platform which is either on a smartphone or web-based. Solice metaverse is compatible with wearable VR/AR tech out of the box which will make users fully enjoy themselves in the metaverse world.",
      "Besides, the lack of cross-platform functionality is another popular problem. Users are often limited to connecting with other users on the same platform, keeping content and user base centralized. Solice solves this problem by allowing cross-platform options. Whether users are using smartphones, desktop computers, or VR devices, all users can connect to the same metaverse to play, communicate, socialize and even work together.",

With a decentralized system like Filecoin, there is no risk of data loss once it’s stored. The projects’ files are split up, encrypted, and stored on many computers throughout the world.
