      "<p>Yooldo is an X-to-Earn game content platform that will have tokenomics optimized for the content provided by each game, and the form of Earn also varies from game to game. Trouble Punk | Cyber Galz, the first game on the Yooldo platform, is a fighting action game of the battle royale genre. Sharing the short-term plan for the next 03 months,&nbsp;Taik Ki (BlackCrunch) Yeo said, &quot;We are currently updating more characters and more maps within the game. We first had the Closed Beta Test a few months ago and got a lot of analytics and surveys from there. We have already fixed the bugs and issues in the first Beta test version. Additionally, we&rsquo;ll get more game modes and more enjoyment that users can play around with when the second Closed Beta Test releases. In the next three months, there will be a second Closed Beta version, and this second one will also open as well&rdquo;.</p>",
      "<p>When being asked&nbsp;what impressed them the most when being a part of ILAP,&nbsp;&nbsp;Taik Ki (BlackCrunch) Yeo shared that&nbsp;&ldquo;The most amazing thing is that not only the mentors but also the speakers are really insightful with so many ideas they give from their experience in the past. They have already built successful products, and they have been in the market for several years. I have received a lot of helpful information and insights from them when building our product&rdquo;. Simultaneously, from Haya&rsquo;s point of view, &nbsp;&ldquo;I think this program is like a shark tank in the Web3 ecosystem. In addition to getting insights from mentors and speakers as BC mentioned, we also get a lot of support that could develop our projects like the technical AWS support or other exclusive packages from other ILAP partners. It gonna be a great help for the project builder in both the long term and short term as well. Therefore, I think the ILAP program understands what Web3 Startups want and how to support Web3 projects better. This really the most thing that impresses me a lot&rdquo;.</p>",

    "content": [
      "Since the latter half of 2021, GameFi and metaverse have driven the crypto market; henceforth, a dozen of crypto games have launched per month and led to a wider selection of games that users can choose from. But as one delves deeper into this space, crypto games are actually facing hardships in implementing a sustainable in-game economy. Simultaneously, even emerging metaverses are extant only on trailers, casting doubt on the wide discrepancy between vision and reality. The market is starting to see faltering games with a short-term focus and an unsustainable in-game economy.",
      "Sharing a common vision and understanding of the potentials for and challenges to the future of GameFi and metaverse, Hashed and Icetea Labs shook hands to form a strategic partnership without termination dates.",
      "To be specific, the two strategic partners will explore the details to cooperate closely in an on-hands manner in GameFi and metaverse with regard to R&D and financing, ranging from infrastructure layers, platforms, and services, to interoperable flagship products, supporting the full lifecycle of games and metaverses (i.e. tokenomics design, launch plan, marketing, and etc.).",

      "Jun Park, Investment Associate at Hashed focusing on crypto investments through the eyes of gaming: “In reality, the number of crypto games that are officially launched with meaningful daily active users is low. I have noticed faltering projects which were not able to converge their vision and reality at the end of the day. From 2022 along with Icetea Labs, I hope to see and will actively search for genuine GameFi projects with the following, non-exhaustive traits: 1) fair game mechanics; 2) play-to-earn through time-based efforts; 3) circular economy with low treasury intervention; 4) gaming fundamentals being fun at its core.”",
      "Edward Hong, Head of Growth at Hashed: “SEA (Southeast Asia) is the region with the fastest-growing adoption of blockchain games and GameFi. It is mesmerizing that blockchain games like Axie Infinity are now entirely transforming the economic patterns of people living in the region. Through this partnership, Hashed will work closely with Icetea Labs in the region to actively discover founders and support them to create a new value.”",
      "Thi Truong, founder of Icetea Labs: \"Blockchain gaming and metaverse industry suffer if companies just want to take away from it rather than contributing. There are many missing pieces and supporting systems that need to be built seriously and with a long-term vision in mind. In 2022 and the years to come, Icetea Labs devotes itself to research and experiments of sustainable economic models, designing cross-game and cross-metaverse mechanisms, building workforce and inhabitants for metaverses, and collaborating on infrastructure effort. We are very happy to work together with Hashed, one of the most visionary leaders in crypto space, on this journey.\"",

Many platforms are supported in the Solice metaverse, removing the barrier of disparate hardware, software, and operating systems. This allows users to invite more friends and family, increasing the user base's exponential growth potential.",

The governance mechanism will be based on a liquid democracy and real-world inspiration rules and done via a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).",

      "One of the most exciting aspects of Solice is the limitless possibilities in its open 3D world: a Metaverse VR where users can play, build, own, exchange, and monetize their virtual experiences in an immersive way on the Solana blockchain.",
      "What makes Solice different from current metaverse projects is the ability to improve the user experience, connecting them through VR and cross-platform technology. Currently, most metaverse projects are only on a single platform which is either on a smartphone or web-based. Solice metaverse is compatible with wearable VR/AR tech out of the box which will make users fully enjoy themselves in the metaverse world.",
      "Besides, the lack of cross-platform functionality is another popular problem. Users are often limited to connecting with other users on the same platform, keeping content and user base centralized. Solice solves this problem by allowing cross-platform options. Whether users are using smartphones, desktop computers, or VR devices, all users can connect to the same metaverse to play, communicate, socialize and even work together.",

      "As a notable gaming and metaverse incubator and enabler in Asia, Icetea Labs pays particular attention not only to researching, building the workforce and inhabitants of metaverses, but also collaborating on infrastructure efforts.",
      "The collaboration will see Icetea Labs becoming the bridge between Filecoin and future projects within our ecosystem that aim to have a large number of users and content uploaded. Filecoin can be a compelling alternative to traditional web services with the ability to make information and data persist in a secure, private manner. With a decentralized system like Filecoin, there is no risk of data loss once it’s stored. The projects’ files are split up, encrypted, and stored on many computers throughout the world. It helps avoid relying on trusted third parties, or vendors who keep the data hostage. Furthermore, the cost of storing data on Filecoin is remarkably lower than centralized enterprises today.",
      "Through this collaboration, Filecoin will support Web3 games and metaverse projects within IceTea Labs’ network on their storage and infrastructure needs. In addition, projects using IPFS and Filecoin (and services like NFT.storage, Estuary, Web3.storage) for decentralized storage are eligible for a $5,000 grant.  Eligible projects can apply here. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.",
      "At the same time, Icetea Labs will work with Filecoin and the Protocol Labs ecosystem fund to invest in and support high-quality open metaverse projects.",
      "Icetea Labs and Filecoin will collaborate to open up more opportunities that benefit projects and development teams in the blockchain space in terms of decentralized data storage, funding, and launchpads. Both parties will explore further collaborations and foster a long-term relationship to support new ideas in the open metaverse and other fields of common interest.",
